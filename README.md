Solutions for problems in Advent of Code 2023: https://adventofcode.com/2023

Goals:

- If using R, everything in base R, i.e. no loading of packages; Possible exception: any day that requires handling numbers too large for base R, e.g. gmp for modular arithmetic with integers too large for base R's %/% and %%. No regex.
- If using Factor, everything goes, because I haven't used it before.
